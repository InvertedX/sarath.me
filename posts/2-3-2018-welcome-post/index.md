I have been thinking about writing blog about my developer life. I found a lot solutions for different problems during my developer life ,so I want share them with you guys. hope you guys will find my blog useful 



 ## How did I built this blog ?

I have couple of blogging site before, most of them are based on popular CMS like WordPress , joomla etc. but when I learned the capabilities of *Markdown* I want build my blog completely on markdown .finally I ended up in [gatsbjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) . I really loved its plugin ecosystem the best part is its based on React. one of my favorite UI framework in JS.

my previous site was on Vue js with NUXT for SSR. and [Bulma]('https://bulma.io/').

so i moved vue to react with Gatsby and its so awesome .every page on this site is static html.which is generated by gatsby. 

the cool thing I found about gatsby is that you have a verity of plugin options. **seriously** this is amazing you can use gatsby with any popular blogging platform.

 I am using [Typora](https://typora.io/) a markdown editor with rich UI and amazing UX. this is my default markdown editor



##What I am going to share here

Mostly my about coding related articles may be something about Astronomy. I am a full stack web and android developer. so you can expect more about android and web related posts. i have been mostly working on these areas 

>  android ,vue , react ,react-native, node, electron , laravel, etc...
